***Notes for how to structure URL Routing***

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/150505/capturing-url-parameters-in-request-get

Update: When deciding whether to use the URL path or the query parameters for passing information, the following may help:

use the URL path for uniquely identifying resources, e.g. /blog/post/15/ (not /blog/posts/?id=15)
use query parameters for changing the way the resource is displayed, e.g. /blog/post/15/?show_comments=1 or /blog/posts/2008/?sort_by=date&direction=desc
to make human friendly URLs, avoid using ID numbers and use e.g. dates, categories and/or slugs: /blog/post/2008/09/30/django-urls/
