            This site was created to serve the STS9 community providing a means for archiving and providing statistical
            data
            on setlists.
        <p>
            You will also find the option to track your personal shows/statistics by logging in via Social Auth
            (Facebook, Google, or Twitter) and navigating to the myShows and myStats links.
        <p>
            Local accounts are not supported
            for security reasons. It makes the site easier to manage and much safer for the end users as passwords are
            not stored on the site.

        <h3>
            Stats Info
        </h3>
        <br>
        <P>
            For the most part the statistics are self explanatory and similar to other sites except for what I mention
            below.
        <p>
            The most notable type of stats that differ from other typical setlist tracking sites is the 'Heat Charts'
            you will find for specific songs.
        <p>
            Through my research and development of the site and data model and comparison to other sites I was finding
            chronologically skewed data in
            regards to song occurrences. Using the song Kamuy as an example, in the year 2005 it was played 33 times and
            in 2012 it was played 15 times.
            Looking at a typical 'Count Based' Occurrences by year chart this would lead you to believe that they really
            liked to play that song in 2005 but in
            reality the data is skewed because the total shows they played in 2012 (38 Shows) was significantly less
            than in 2005 (94 Shows). That's where song heat
            charts come in. They base the frequency of the song by a percentage factor of total shows that year.
            According to the Heat Chart, Kamuy was
            played @ 35% of the shows in 2005, and @ 39% of shows in 2012. So you can see from this information that
            they were playing that song just as much
            both years relative to how many shows they played that year.
        <p>
            This same concept is also applied to the 'Weekdays Heat Chart', and the 'Month Heat Chart' because just like
            years, weekdays and certain months have disproportionate
            amount of total shows played as well. For example Saturday and Sunday make up 50% of all of the shows STS9
            has played. Also, March, April, Sept, and October make up
            almost 50% of all shows played. Therefore it is very important when running statistics involving the
            distribution of a particular song you take these things into account.
            These are very interesting charts as you can see trends of when the band likes to play certain songs. For
            example, for whatever reason they like to play 'Rent' @ 1 out of every 3 (33%) shows in August
            which is quite significantly more than any other month. Another interesting one is that they like to play
            '...And Some Are Angels' @ 22% of shows on Wednesdays.

        <p>
            I <a href="mailto:movemypeeps9@email.com">Brent Vaalburg</a> came up with the Idea in Summer 2016. I did
            alot of research about
            different web frameworks and backend programming languagues and decided on using Python/Django because of
            its popularity and Python's ability
            to deal with Data and Mathematical operations well in conjunction with great libraries such as numPy. I then began building custom
            data scraping tools and began scraping
            data from various sources for the project and migrating it to a PostgreSQL Database.
