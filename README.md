***STS9 Setlist Project (squaresandcubes.net)***

Hello,

Welcome to the STS9 setlist/statistics web project. The purpose of this project is to build a central setlists database for the band Sound Tribe Sector 9. My goal is to archive as much data as possible and have many statistics available to users. Right now the database contains ~1480 shows.

A litte background and information about the project.

Inception:

I came up with the Idea in 2016. I began learning Python and Web Scraping tools. I created several differnt tools to scrape data from various sources of data for the project. If you are interested in the details of this you can contact me. At this point the data is all imported into the database so it is not really relevant anymore.

Most of the DATA is from Setlists.fm in which I exported all of the data to XML and then built a custom scraping tool in python to dump all the data to PostgreSQL, this has been a great resource.

***Current Tech***

The Stack:

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Linux OS)  
Python 3.7.4 (Backend Language)  
PostgreSQL 10.8 (Relational Database)  
Django 2.2.5 (Backend Framework in Python)  
Gunicorn 19.9.0 (Python WSGI Server)  
NGINX 1.14.0 (HTTP Server)

***Setlist Prediction w/ AI/Machine Learning*** (TensorFlow): 

I was thinking to do this just for Fun. If it ends up being too accurate maybe I will not do it haha:) Because, it would kinda be a buzzkill to know what you are going to see. I'll play this one by ear.
